# About

A list of programming challenges for beginners and experts alike. The list is compiled from various programming challenge "sources" (mainly /g/'s 'Pro/g/ramming challenges' lists), and contains challenges with various levels of difficulty.

## Contributing

I initially made this for myself and some friends, however anyone is more than welcome to contribute. You may:

- Take any approach and use any language you wish to solve the challenges. 
- Solve challenges that have already been solved by somebody else
- Submit ideas for new challenges or changes to thes list

As mentioned above, each challenge can be solved multiple times by multiple people, as the goal of this list is not to solve every single challenge listed, but rather to have the people solving them learn something new and get better at coding. So if there's a challenge which you want to take a shot at, but someone else has already coded a solution for it, then you don't need to worry about it.

### How to contribute

1. Clone this repository in a directory or your choice:
```
git clone sdfkjdsjgosijs
```

2. Make a folder (if it does not exist already) named after the task you are attempting, for example:
```
mkdir temperature_converter
```

3. In that folder, include your solution as one or more file(s), identifying it using your github username. If your solution contains multiple files, make *another* folder, also named after your GH username, and include all files in there. For example:
```
temperature_converter/
├── username1.py
└── username2/
    ├── file1.py
    └── file2.py
```

Where ```username1``` is a contributor with a solution using only 1 file, and ```username2``` is a contributor with a solution containing multiple files (and therefore warranting a folder).
