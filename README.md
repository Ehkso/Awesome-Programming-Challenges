# About

A list of simple programming challenges that are not only good for beginners, but fun for intermediate/experience coders. The list is compiled of various programming exercises and challenges, the vast majority of which are fairly
simple and good for beginners, with a handful of notably difficult outliers, although those are still nothing daunting. 

## Contributing

I initially made this for myself and some friends, however anyone is more than welcome to contribute. You may:

- Take any approach and use any language you wish to solve the challenges. 
- Solve challenges that have already been solved by somebody else
- Submit ideas for new challenges or changes to the list

As mentioned above, each challenge can be solved multiple times by multiple people, as the goal of this list is not to solve every single challenge listed, but rather to have the people solving them learn something new and get better at coding. So if there's a challenge which you want to take a shot at, but someone else has already coded a solution for it, then you don't need to worry about it.

### How to contribute

1. Clone this repository in a directory or your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/Zsargul/Programming-Challenges
```

2. Make a folder (if it does not exist already) named after the task you are attempting, for example:
```
mkdir temperature_converter
```

The folder names for each challenge can be found in the list (url to list here)

3. In that folder, create another folder named after your Github username. That folder will contain your file(s) for the solution you have created. In brief, your submission should look something like this in the file directory:
__Example:__
```
temperature_converter/your_username/your_solution.py

```
for a single file, or:
```
temperature_converter/
└── your_username/
    ├── solution_file1.py
    └── solution_file2.py
```
for a multi-file solution.

## CHALLENGES:

Due to the fact that the difficulty of each task is VERY subjective, the challenges are not categorized by difficulty.
