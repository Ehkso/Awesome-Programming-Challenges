# About

A list of programming challenges for beginners and experts alike. The list is compiled from various programming challenge "sources" (mainly /g/'s 'Pro/g/ramming challenges' lists), and contains challenges with various levels of difficulty.

## Contributing

I initially made this for myself and some friends, however anyone is more than welcome to contribute. You may take any approach and use any language you wish to solve the challenges. You may also solve challenges that have already been solved by somebody else, as the goal of this list is not to solve every single challenge listed, but rather to have the people solving them learn something new and get better at coding. So if there's a challenge which you want to take a shot at, but someone else has already coded a solution for it, then that should be the last of your worries!

To contribute a challenge, clone this repository and make a folder named after the challenge you are undertaking (if it does not exist already). In that folder, create your code file which will contain your solution, and name it after your github username (If your solution contains more than 1 file, make a folder named after you Github username and include the files in that instead).
